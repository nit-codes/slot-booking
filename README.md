# slot-booking
This is a small HTML project which uses basic functions and tags. This website is a simple idea of parking slot booking website.   

I have uploaded just my initial commit. In this initial version it has the following features:
* You can enter your car number and select the slot of your choice and book it.
* if the slot you are looking for is already booked then it suggests you the nearby empty slots.

In the upcoming update these features will be added:
* a timer to keep track of how many minutes the vehicle has been parked.
* automatic cost generator by using the time taken by a particular vehicle
